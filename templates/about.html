    <h1>About TwoToro</h1>
    <div class="tagline">Powered Learning Together</div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Welcome to TwoToro—a place where we believe that learning is best when it’s shared. Born out of a personal challenge and a passion for making quality tutoring accessible, TwoToro is more than just a platform—it’s a community built on collaboration and empowerment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>My journey with tutoring started in a rather unexpected way. I was paying $35 a month for Zoom, not only to connect with tutors for my daughter but also to cover the cost of a separate tutor login. Frustrated by these unnecessary expenses, I thought, “There’s got to be a better way.” I knew I could build a solution that made learning more affordable and efficient. And so, TwoToro was born.</p>
      <p>Inspired by the strength and determination symbolized by the word “toro” (bull), and the power of two coming together, TwoToro was created to merge technology with the human element of tutoring. We’re here to challenge the status quo—because learning should never be hindered by high costs or outdated tools.</p>
